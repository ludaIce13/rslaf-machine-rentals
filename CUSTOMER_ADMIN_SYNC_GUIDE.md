# Customer Portal → Admin Portal Order Sync Guide

## Current Situation

### ✅ What Works:
- Customer portal booking flow (complete)
- Payment processing (complete)
- Order storage in customer portal localStorage
- Admin portal order display system
- Manual order addition in admin portal

### ❌ What Doesn't Work Automatically:
- Cross-domain order sync (customer → admin)
- Real-time order updates between portals

## Temporary Solution

### For Each New Customer Order:
1. **Customer completes booking** in customer portal
2. **Admin manually adds order** using "Add Manual Order" button
3. **Enter customer details** from the booking
4. **Order appears immediately** in admin portal

## Long-term Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: Shared Database (Recommended)
- Deploy backend API with PostgreSQL
- Both portals connect to same database
- Real-time sync automatically

### Option 2: Webhook Integration
- Customer portal sends webhook on order creation
- Admin portal receives webhook and adds order
- Near real-time sync

### Option 3: Email Notifications
- Customer portal emails order details to admin
- Admin manually enters from email
- Simple but manual process

## Current Workflow

### Customer Side:
1. Browse equipment
2. Fill booking form
3. Choose payment method
4. Complete payment
5. ✅ Order stored locally

### Admin Side:
1. Check for new bookings (manual process)
2. Click "Add Manual Order"
3. Enter customer details
4. ✅ Order appears in system

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term**: Use manual order addition
2. **Medium-term**: Implement shared database
3. **Long-term**: Full API integration with real-time sync
